//finding a digit and swap its position in the number to obtain the largest possible value
//51229 -> impossible largest value is 92251 aftet swap 
//propose an algorithm using interation and implement it in C to complete the task
//propose and implement an alternative algorithm using recursion for this task 
//calculate the complexity of the two approaches.justify your answer by making comment on the code

int swap(int n){

}
